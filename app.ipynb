         " Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation",
         "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",

         " Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name Coded Into His Website (IMAGES)",
         "On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row. The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z. As others have noted in this thread, this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display, but who knows.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem. Still not clear when these messages would actually display, since the actual 404 (and presumably 500) page displays a different message pic.twitter.com/Z7dmyQ5smy  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017That suggests someone at either RNC or the Trump admin is sensitive enough to Trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed. You have no idea how much I d love to see the email exchange that led us here.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017 The code was f-cked up.The best part about this is that they are using the  =  (assignment) operator which means that bit of code will never get run. If you look a few lines up  errorCode  will always be  404          (@tw1trsux) December 28, 2017trump s coders can t code. Nobody is surprised.

         " Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech",
         "Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",

         "As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. ",

         "U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. ",

         "Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job'",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said. ",

         "FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat tip-off: NYT",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. ",

         "Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments",
         "SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. ",

         "New Zealand's kingmaker party sets Thursday to unveil result of talks to form government",
         "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s small nationalist party, which holds the balance of power after last month s inconclusive elections, will make an announcement on Thursday on the result of talks with the two major parties to form the next government. The move should put an end to weeks of political uncertainty in the small Pacific island nation, after neither major party won enough seats on Sept. 23 to form a government, leaving both courting the leader of New Zealand First, Winston Peters.  New Zealand First will be in a position tomorrow afternoon to make an announcement on the result of negotiations following the 2017 general election,  the party said in a statement. Thursday s event could also shed light on the economic direction for New Zealand, since both the National Party and the Labour Party differ on immigration and trade, key sources of the country s robust growth in recent years. Peters has held lengthy talks with both National, which has been in power for nearly a decade, and opposition Labour, but has kept his cards close to his chest regarding coalition prospects. Peters has notified the leaders of both parties about Thursday s announcement, the statement added. The New Zealand dollar, already under pressure earlier on Wednesday, briefly fell to the day s low of $0.7153 after the statement.  If it goes down the path of a Labour-Green coalition, we can expect the kiwi will probably come under far greater pressure, purely on the basis that that is a complete unknown,  said Stuart Ive, a dealer at OM Financial.  If it s announced that a National coalition is being formed, we can probably see the kiwi pick back up again,  in a short relief rally before markets return to focusing on economic fundamentals, he added, using the currency s nickname. NZ First has more in common with Labour on the policy front, as both want to rein in immigrants and foreign ownership, change certain trade deals and adjust the central bank s mandate. But some analysts say a two-way coalition with National would be more straightforward than a three-way coalition with Labour and the Greens. Labour needs the seats of both the Greens and New Zealand First to reach a majority in parliament.  ",

         "Jewish groups in Germany urge crackdown on anti-Semitic acts",
         "BERLIN (Reuters) - Jewish groups in Germany are pressing the authorities to crack down on anti-Semitic acts following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags at protests. The American Jewish Committee Berlin, the JSUD group of Jewish university students, the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and the German-Israeli Society have called for tougher law enforcement and for new laws to make it easier to ban or disband anti-Semitic demonstrations. Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top German officials have  condemned anti-Semitic acts seen at demonstrations against U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and vowed to prosecute illegal acts. The American Jewish Committee Berlin said a new study by an Indiana University professor showed broader efforts were also needed to fight anti-Semitic attitudes among Muslim migrants from Syria and Iraq. German has opened its borders to more than 1 million migrants mainly fleeing Middle East wars since 2015, sparking concerns about a further bump in already increasing anti-Semitism.  Politicians must guarantee that anti-Semitic attitudes will not be tolerated and that infractions to laws and regulations will be prosecuted,  said the group s director, Deidre Berger. She reiterated a longstanding call for the German government to appoint an anti-Semitism commissioner to focus attention on the issue. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas and Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller vowed during a menorah lighting at the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday to combat all forms of anti-Semitism, while demonstrators continued to voice anger at the U.S. move at a separate event near Berlin s main train station. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany has also condemned anti-Semitic actions. Indiana University s Guenther Jikeli, the author of the study, said group interviews of 68 migrants aged 18 to 52 conducted last year revealed widespread anti-Semitic attitudes. They showed rejection of the state of Israel and ignorance about the murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by the Nazis during World War Two, he said.  There are strong anti-Semitic views among refugees that need to be addressed because otherwise they could become the norm,  he told Reuters TV. Kurds and other refugees persecuted as minorities in their home countries had more nuanced views and more clearly rejected anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli perspectives, he said. Fabian Weissbarth, spokesman for AJC, said the study should spur efforts to tackle anti-Semitism among migrants to ensure the findings were not misused by anti-immigrant far-right groups like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  If we don t address it as a society, then the AfD will, and that will lead to hate and incitement,  he said.  We need a differentiated view that recognizes that not all refugees are the same, and we need to look at solutions, such as integration measures, what needs to be included in integration courses, and changes in how social workers and politicians react.

         "Factbox: What's in the final U.S. Republican tax bill",
         "(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is expected to vote this week on sweeping, debt-financed tax legislation. Here are key parts of the bill. CORPORATE TAX RATE: Cuts corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, beginning Jan. 1, 2018. PASS-THROUGHS: Creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. For income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   CORPORATE MINIMUM TAX: Repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. TERRITORIAL SYSTEM: Exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all U.S.-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. This would align the U.S. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  REPATRIATION: Sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in U.S. business profits now held overseas. This foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the United States, or repatriated. That rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. ANTI-BASE EROSION MEASURES: Prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. Sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between U.S. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. In combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. tax system for multinationals. CAPITAL EXPENSING: Allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. INTEREST DEDUCTION LIMIT: Caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  CLEAN ENERGY: Preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. CARRIED INTEREST: Leaves in place “carried interest” loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by Republicans including President Donald Trump to close it. These financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. A new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers, but preserving its availability for many.   BRACKETS: Maintains the current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most of the income levels and rates. For married couples filing jointly, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. For single individuals, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. These brackets would expire after 2025. STANDARD DEDUCTION: In a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of Americans, the bill for eight years beginning on Jan. 1, 2018 would increase the standard deduction - a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income - to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. CHILD TAX CREDIT: Doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child under age 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. The refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value. PERSONAL EXEMPTION: Temporarily eliminates the $4,050 individual personal exemption. Under present law, taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes. Generally, one exemption has been allowed per individual, spouse and child or other dependent. This would take effect Jan. 1, 2018, but then the personal exemption would return in 2026.  INHERITANCES: Raises the exemption for estate and gift taxes to $10 million from $5 million per person and indexes the new exemption level for inflation after 2011. That means even fewer Americans would pay the estate tax, but it would stay on the books. MORTGAGES: For residences bought from Jan. 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2025, the bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $750,000 in home loan value. After Dec. 31, 2025, the cap would revert to $1 million in loan value. Suspends the deduction for interest on home equity loans from Jan. 1, 2018 until 2026. OBAMACARE MANDATE: Repeals a federal fine imposed on Americans under Obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage, a change expected to undermine the 2010 healthcare law.   ANWR DRILLING: Allows oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ",

         " WATCH: Kimmel Tells Hypocrite Trump He’s ‘Full Of Sh*t’ To His Face",
         "Donald Trump s past support of Hillary Clinton came back to bite him on the ass during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.During the Wednesday night broadcast, Kimmel introduced presumptive Republican nominee Trump and after briefly chiding him for his taco bowl tweet on Cinco de Mayo proceeded to ask him if he really thought his campaign for the presidency would ever get this far. When you started all this, I just have to believe that you thought  This will be fun, it ll be a four month thing  and you never imagined it would go this far. Is that true?  Kimmel asked.Trump replied that he didn t think his campaign would come out on top so quickly. He thought there would end up being two conventions with one in July and one in August to determine the GOP nominee. Trump also claimed that he believed Hillary would have won the Democratic nomination long before now, but said he enjoys watching her.Kimmel then asked Trump if he is  enjoying the Hillary/Bernie struggle.  Well I do,  Trump said. And then Trump failed to see the irony as called the battle between to two Democrats  nasty  and that he hates to see that. It s getting nasty,  Trump continued.  I had no idea it was going to be so nasty. And you hate that,  Kimmel replied.  You don t like that. Yeah, I hate to see it,  Trump answered.  I hate to see it. Donald Trump s campaign is one of the nastiest in American political history, perhaps only topped by the 1828 Election.At rally after rally, Trump has spewed violent rhetoric, encouraged intimidation, and launched racist and sexist attacks against anyone who opposes him, including Hillary Clinton, whose husband has been the latest target of vicious attacks by Trump.The mentioning of Hillary Clinton, however, gave Kimmel the opportunity to hilariously hit Trump with statements he made about Hillary in 2008 and 2012. In 2008 you said you thought Hillary  would make an excellent president  and as recently as 2012 you said you thought she was  terrific.' Kimmel asked Trump to explain why he made those remarks and what has changed.Trump claimed that he says good things about all politicians as a businessman, to which Kimmel replied,  So you were full of shit when you said that. Trump could only shake his head in agreement and smile.Here s the video via YouTube.Kimmel definitely caught Trump with a brilliantly laid out trap.Featured Image: Screenshot",

         "Trump, in Oval Office, signs first order on Obamacare",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump directed government agencies on Friday to freeze regulations and take steps to weaken Obamacare, using his first hours in the White House to make good on a campaign promise to start dismantling his predecessor’s healthcare law. Heading into the Oval Office shortly after the conclusion of his inaugural parade, Trump signed an order on the Affordable Care Act that urged government departments to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions that imposed fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. It also called for efforts to give states greater flexibility in implementing healthcare programs while developing “a free and open market in interstate commerce for the offering of healthcare services and health insurance.” Health experts had speculated that Trump could expand exemptions from the so-called individual mandate, which requires Americans to carry insurance or face a penalty, or the requirement that employers offer coverage.  Experts also believe the administration could try to reduce the “essential benefits,” such as maternity care and mental health services, that insurance plans must cover. The White House did not provide further details about the executive order. Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer said the White House also directed an immediate regulatory freeze for all government agencies in a memo from Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. He did not offer details. Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, one of former President Barack Obama’s signature laws, was a central pledge for Trump during the presidential election campaign. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have not yet laid out a plan to recast the insurance program. In a hastily arranged ceremony, surrounded by some of his aides, Trump sat behind the presidential Resolute Desk and signed the order. He also signed commissions for his newly confirmed defense secretary, James Mattis, and his homeland security secretary, John Kelly. Trump spoke briefly about his day with reporters. “It was busy, but good. It was a beautiful day,” he said. Vice President Mike Pence then swore in Mattis and Kelly in a separate ceremony. There were other signs of change in the Oval Office, which Obama vacated on Friday morning. Golden drapes hung where crimson ones had earlier in the day and new furniture dotted the room. ",

         "Defense Secretary Mattis promises support to Ukraine, says reviewing lethal aid",
         "KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on a visit to Ukraine on Thursday said Washington would keep up pressure on Russia over what he called its aggressive behavior and signaled his personal support for providing weapons to Kiev. Mattis said Russia had not abided by the Minsk ceasefire agreement meant to end the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and that the United States would maintain sanctions on Moscow.    Despite Russia s denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe,  Mattis told reporters, alongside Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Mattis s visit, timed for Ukrainian Independence Day, is the second high-profile show of U.S. support in as many months, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came to Kiev in July.    Ukraine has counted on U.S. support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014 when the Kremlin-backed president fled the country. But some of President Donald Trump s comments during the election campaign last year, such as appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, stoked fears in Kiev that Trump might mend ties with Moscow at Ukraine s expense. While emphasizing Trump had yet to take a decision on the issue, Mattis signaled his personal support for a longstanding Ukrainian request for defensive weapons, which could include anti-tank Javelin missiles and anti-aircaft systems. Mattis also played down fears, voiced by the previous White House administration under Barack Obama, that supplying weapons could escalate the situation.   On the defensive lethal weapons, we are actively reviewing it, I will go back now having seen the current situation and be able to inform the secretary of state and the president in very specific terms what I recommend for the direction ahead,  Mattis said.  Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their own territory where the fighting is happening,  Mattis said. Poroshenko said he was  satisfied  with the progress on discussions about weapons, and also said he and Mattis had discussed the possibility of a U.N.-backed armed force being sent to eastern Ukraine. Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscow s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people. Russia denies sending troops and weapons to eastern Ukraine.  According to U.S. officials, a plan to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine has made its way to the White House but has not been signed. Thus far the Pentagon says it has provided $750 million in non-lethal aid to Ukraine since 2015, which includes radars and uniforms. Supplying weapons  will be a huge boost of support to Ukraine,  said Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the region. Carpenter said the weapons under discussion cannot effectively be used to take territory, which means providing them would help stabilize the situation. U.S. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, also pressed the Trump administration to act.   Secretary Mattis  visit to Kiev provides yet another opportunity for the United States to correct its policy toward Ukraine and provide the lethal defensive assistance the country needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,  McCain said in a statement on Wednesday.  Mattis  strong words against Moscow on Thursday are likely to reassure eastern European allies who are concerned about Russia s military activity in region, including planned war games in September. Russia and Belarus aim to hold joint exercises that some North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013. Earlier this year, Estonia s defense minister said Russia may use the exercises to move thousands of troops permanently into Belarus in a warning to NATO. Russia has dismissed Western worries about the war games as  buffoonery . ",

         " WATCH: Colbert Asks Tapper How CNN Staff Feels About Their Feud With Trump; His Response Is PERFECT",
         "Donald Trump is no fan of CNN. He has repeatedly tried to discredit and delegitimize the network, even going so far as to call them fake news and refuse to answer a question from one of their reporters during the only press conference he has held since Inauguration Day.Well, one of CNN s best anchors, Jake Tapper, who hosts The Lead and State of the Union, stopped by the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, and of course the topic of Trump came up. More specifically, the topic of CNN s relationship with Trump came up. After the niceties were exchanged Colbert started out by reading a list of insulting adjectives that Trump had used to describe the network, then went on to ask Tapper: Why are you so mean to him, Jake? If you guys just didn t fact-check him anymore, he wouldn t be saying these things about you. Tapper responded: That s a good point. Then, Colbert went on to say: What s it like in the halls over there knowing that the president actively doesn t like your network? Tapper then delivered the best   and presumably honest   zinger that would really hit home for Trump: I don t think anybody cares. Now, this is important because Trump NEEDS people to care about him, how he feels, what he says, what he thinks. As Tapper points out, it is not a reporter s job to be liked. It is a reporter s job to hold people accountable. Now that we have a president and a White House that actively lies on a routine basis to the American public, it s vital to the survival of our democracy that Tapper and those like him continue to fact-check Trump, no matter how many insane insults he throws at them.The relevant part comes a couple of minutes into the following video, but the entire interview is beyond awesome:Featured image via video screen capture",

         "U.S. navy recovers remains of all sailors missing after USS McCain collision",
         "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Monday confirmed recovery of the remains of all  10 sailors killed after the warship John S. McCain collided with a merchant vessel in waters near Singapore and Malaysia.  The guided-missile destroyer collided with the Alnic MC east of Singapore last week while approaching the city state on a routine port visit.  The U.S. navy and marine corps divers have now recovered the remains of all 10 USS John S.McCain sailors,  the Seventh Fleet said in a statement on its website.  The news follows the navy s Thursday announcement that it had suspended wider search and rescue operations after finding and identifying the remains of one sailor. The navy found the remains of missing sailors inside sealed sections of the damaged hull of the warship, which is moored at Singapore s Changi Naval Base.  The incident is under investigation to determine the facts and circumstances of the collision,  the statement added. Aircraft, divers and vessels from Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States joined a search-and-rescue operation for the missing sailors over an area of about 5,500 sq. km. (2,124 square miles) around the crash site. The pre-dawn collision, the fourth major accident for the U.S. Pacific Fleet this year, has prompted a review of its operations. The Navy has removed Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin from his post, citing  a loss of confidence in his ability to command  after the run of accidents. Rear Admiral Phil Sawyer takes command of the fleet from Aucoin, who had been due to step down next month.  The U.S. navy has also flagged plans for temporary and staggered halts in operations across its global fleet to allow staff to focus on safety. In a one-day operational pause last Wednesday, officers and crew of Seventh Fleet ships deployed at a facility in Yokosuka, Japan, received fresh training in risk management and communications. The Seventh Fleet, headquartered in Japan, operates as many as 70 ships, including the U.S. navy s only forward-deployed aircraft carrier, and has about 140 aircraft and 20,000 sailors. ",

         "Syrian Kurds say Russia has promised they can attend Sochi talks",
         "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia has promised that the autonomous region controlled by Kurds in northern Syria will be represented at peace talks it is hosting next month, the commander of the main Syrian Kurdish militia was cited as saying on Wednesday.      Moscow has said 155 representatives of the autonomous region will participate, Sipan Hemo, the commander of the YPG, was quoted as saying by official Syrian Kurdish social media channels on Wednesday.  Kurdish groups have not taken part in any round of Syrian peace talks so far despite their control of more than a quarter of Syria. Turkey opposes their involvement in talks. Moscow backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria s six-year-old civil war while Turkey opposes him.  But Ankara views the YPG as a terrorist group affiliated to the Kurdish PKK, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey for decades.  Russia, Iran and Turkey announced the Jan. 29-30 dates for the talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi date after a round of peace talks in Kazakhstan last week, but did not say who would participate. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday called Assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for Syrian peace efforts to continue with him. Syria responded that Erdogan himself supported terrorist groups fighting in Syria. About 40 Syrian rebel groups, including factions that have taken part in other rounds of peace talks, said on Monday they would refuse to attend the Sochi congress. Russia is the most powerful supporter of Assad. Its jets have helped him bring the rebellion against his rule near to an end, and rebels say Moscow has put no pressure on him to find a political solution.  U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura has said that the success of the congress should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the U.N.-led Geneva talks on ending the war.  ",

         "U.S. House passes bill to fund government through September",
         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a $1.2 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September and avoid federal agency shutdowns on Saturday when existing money is depleted. With the 309-118 vote in the Republican-controlled chamber, the legislation now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it before a midnight Friday deadline. The Pentagon is a big winner in the legislation, with defense spending rising significantly. While the bill cleared the House easily, dozens more Democrats voted for it than Republicans, many of whom oppose most spending measures. This was the first major legislation to pass the House this year with bipartisan support and marks Republican President Donald Trump’s first legislative victory, even though he railed against some of its provisions. The legislation bulks up federal funding for border security but does not pay for starting construction on a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump promised to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. Trump had said he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the Mexican government refused, making it necessary for the new administration to ask Congress for the money. Democrats and many Republicans have argued that a wall is an ineffective and wasteful way of securing the southern border. Another battle over the barrier is expected when Congress tries to pass a spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Trump already has begun focusing on that upcoming fight. In a tweet on Tuesday, he taunted lawmakers, saying, “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” The legislation would add $12.5 billion this fiscal year for the Pentagon, with another $2.5 billion available after Trump gives details on his plans for defeating the Islamic State militant group. It ignores many of the spending cuts on domestic programs the White House had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Rico’s underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million to fight fires in Western states. But the legislation is late in coming. The fiscal year began last Oct. 1 and for the last seven months federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous year’s funding and the priorities that came with that.

         "THE STATE THAT GETS MORE REFUGEES THAN ANY OTHER IN AMERICA MAY SURPRISE YOU",
         "Here s one sure way to turn a solidly  red  state  blue In Fiscal year 2014, Texas resettled 7,234 refugees. However, that doesn t tell the whole story because according to the Texas Dept. of State Health Services (an excellent source of information on refugees in Texas), the actual number of migrants legally being treated as refugees last year was really 12,800 (up 24% from the previous year!).The website also tells you which counties got the most refugees.The 12,800 includes refugees, asylees, parolees, special immigrant visa holders (these are Afghans and Iraqis), and victims of trafficking.They hailed from 58 countries (therefore Texas taxpayers are on the hook for many expensive translators gratis a Bill Clinton executive order for all sorts of reasons access to health care, school system problems and the criminal justice system).When I went to several different sources, I find that over 150,000 refugees have been resettled in Texas since 1983, and that number doesn t include secondary migrants from other states (Dallas County got the most secondary migrants last year 60% of all those arriving in Texas).And, of course, it doesn t include all of the children produced in three decades! Nor does it include the thousands of  unaccompanied alien children  that may not have been distributed around the nation from last year s border invasion. Obama would like nothing more than to have them declared  refugees  as well (refugees get all forms of welfare upon arrival!).The top resettlement cities in Texas are (resettlement is not limited to these sites, dozens and dozens of smaller cities and towns are receiving refugees):AbileneAmarilloAustinCorpus ChristiDallasEl PasoFort WorthHoustonSan AntonioFor new readers, you might want to have a look at our archive on Amarillo which has developed into a  pocket of resistance  as the mayor there has asked the federal government to slow the flow since the school system is suffering with the influx of non-English speaking children many of whom are illiterate in their own language. The meatpacking industry is responsible for much of the resettlement to Amarillo (hunger for cheap labor!).The top nations from which Texas received refugees in 2014 were in this order: Iraq, Cuba, Burma, Afghanistan, and tied for 5th place Somalia and Bhutan(Nepal).So when did Texas move into the number one spot in the nation?For years and years other states ranked above Texas including California, New York and Florida. According to this very cool graph (above right), it was in 2011 that Texas gained this dubious distinction.And, if you are wondering why the number dipped in 2011, this is why: That year it was learned that Iraqi terrorists disguised as refugees were arrested in Kentucky. Turns out the pair had lied (can you believe it, they lied!) on their refugee application and it was only when they were found to be planning on helping Al-Qaeda in Iraq was it discovered that one of them had left fingerprints on an IED shard that was warehoused by the US military. The shard came from an IED that had killed Pennsylvania National Guard troops. They are in prison for life.The arrest threw the Refugee Admissions Program of the US State Department into chaos because they had to re-screen thousands and thousands of Iraqis headed to America. Iraqis make up the largest ethnic group we are admitting to America now at a rate of about 20,000 a year. The majority are Muslims (both Shiites and Sunnis as we import their centuries old squabble to your towns!).IT S PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT THAT BARACK OBAMA GAVE THE  Teacher of the year  award to Shanna Peoples,  A high school English teacher from Amarillo, Texas, who works with refugees:In order to question this 35-year-old legal immigration program, you must first get the facts!* Read our Fact Sheet, here. Open and read all the links in this post!* Go to the Texas Department of State Health Services website and learn all you can about the refugees coming to Texas. Don t miss the stats on their health conditions (refugees are admitted with TB, HepB, HIV and parasites).* You have a State Refugee Coordinator and her name is Caitriona Lyons (she is Irish, btw), call her and ask her to direct you to the Texas refugee plan. Here is a description of the plan and the legal requirement that every state have one (and they must keep it current). Ask her to direct you to it and read it!Remember in Texas your governor does have a say in what happens with refugee resettlement! Where has he been?Via: Refugee Resettlement Watch",

         "HILLARY GIVES HILARIOUS Reason For Losing Election: “I Was On The Way To Winning” [VIDEO]",
         "The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",

         "While campaigning for president, Donald Trump announced he would not take a salary if he were elected. True to his word, President Trump has donated his $400,000 annual salary to various government agencies of his choosing.In April, Trump donated his first-quarter salary of $78,333.32 to the National Park Service to fund the agency s battlefield preservation efforts, a program that is currently $229 million behind in deferred costs. Two days ago, President Trump donated $100,000 to the Education Department to help fund a STEM-focused camp for students according to Fortune.Power couple and top aides to the president, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have also declined government salaries for their positions. Today, the Daily Caller announced a new top Trump administration official would not be taking a salary for his job.White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci won t take a salary for his new job, a White House official told The Daily Caller.In the new role as a senior White House aide, Scaramucci could earn $179,000 annually.Scaramucci, a New York financier, made millions before entering the White House.A financial disclosure form he filled out for his previous post as chief strategy officer at the Export-Import Bank showed that Scaramucci made about ten million between January 1 and the end of June from his investment firm SkyBridge Capital, according to Politico.Scaramucci did not take a salary for his role at the Ex-Im Bank, which would have been $172,100 annually.

         "In the past, high school kids have had to worry about getting into the college of their choice, if pictures of them overindulging in adult beverages while on spring break were posted to social media. Today, college students may have to worry about the treatment they ll receive if their college or college professors see pictures or videos of them showing their support for President Trump while on spring break.https://twitter.com/Lexi1095/status/843094566207131649What would be a dream night for Suly and Anaximandro Amable, a newly married couple who went to Cancun for their honeymoon, became a bitter experience on Monday March 13.During a family show on the high seas, young American spring breakers began to sing the controversial  Build That Wall  chant, which shocked Mexican national tourists and workers.This is just one of the many blameworthy behaviors that young spring breakers have shown recently in Cancun and that are described as acts of xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country, which is (or should be) totally unacceptable.Anaximandro, from Per , made the following statement on social networks:  Today I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico), watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not), began to sing the infamous  Build that wall  chant louder and louder .The  Pirate Ship  sails out from Puerto Juarez, and the show takes place in the middle of the ocean, where attendees can witness the clashing of swords and the explosion of cannons along with a constant flow of drinks.For entire story: The Yucatan Times ",

         " Trudeau HUMILIATES Trump, Openly Prefers To Speak To Other U.S. Officials Instead",
         "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has, like the rest of the world, seen the outrage that is Donald Trump occupying the American presidency over the last six months. He likely also has the same disgusted opinion of the job Trump is doing, not to mention his vulgarity, his lies and conspiracy theories, and his all around unfitness for the office he holds. That sort of thing just might be why Prime Minister Trudeau has shown he has no f*cks left to give when it comes to Trump, and has decided that, instead of talking to Trump, he will instead speak to more competent American government officials instead. To that end, Trudeau will become the first Canadian Prime Minister in history to speak to the National Governor s Association. He says of the move: No countries share a closer bond than Canada and the United States. Each day, hundreds of thousands of people cross the border to work, travel or visit loved ones. Ever more integrated supply chains draw our economies closer together, bringing jobs and prosperity to Canadians and Americans alike. I will continue to work with all orders of the U.S. government to create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border, and to find solutions to the challenges we face together. While Trudeau has, as any dignified leader would,  remained civil with Trump, it is clear that the two will not be close at all. Trudeau sees Trump for the buffoon that he is, and has criticized him for his promotion of crude nationalism, his views on climate change, and other topics.This is a clear signal that Trudeau has no use for Trump. He simply has to tolerate the orange one until he is either removed from office or his term expires. Until then, it seems Trudeau will simply go around Trump and deal with other (read: sane and qualified) United States government officials. Personally, I think it s a wise move, because dealing with Trump would be nothing short of maddening, and it certainly would not serve the interests of people in Canada or anywhere else in the world.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

         " WATCH: Sarah Silverman Hilariously Demolishes Trump On Conan",
         "Adolf Hitler isn t enthused about being compared to Republican front runner Donald Trump, according to comedian Sarah Silverman, who dressed up as the Nazi dictator and made an appearance on Conan. After being introduced, Silverman-as-Hitler said: Wow, look at that! I have to say, that s more applause than I expected. Don t get me wrong, Conan. I agree with a lot he says   a lot. Like 90 percent of what he says, I m like, this guy gets it, but I don t like the way he says it. It s crass. In reference to a recent GOP debate when Rubio poked fun of Trump s hands and implicitly referred to the size of his penis, Silverman-as-Hitler had this to say: What kind of person talks about his penis size on national television? Oh yeah, I m so sure Donald Trump has a big penis. I famously have a micro penis. That s what makes a tyrant. Anyway, all these comparisons to Trump, it s like, it bums me out. You know what I mean? Sometimes I watch him and I m like,  Is that how people see me?' Watch the clip here:Trump has received a barrage of criticism, some comparing him to the notorious dictator including Louis CK, who said,  he is dangerous. Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto said Trump s campaign had similarities to the rise of the Nazi leader.In an interview with Good Morning America, Trump said of the comparisons:It s a terrible comparison. I m not happy about that, certainly. I don t want that comparison. But you know we have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant. People agree with that. We don t want to lose our jobs to China. And we don t want to lose our jobs to Mexico and Japan, If Trump doesn t want such comparisons, then he should stop propagating in ways that remind the world of the notorious Nazi dictator.",

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on a powerful U.S. congressional panel are questioning whether Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals may be wrongfully withholding documents in connection with its ongoing probe into sky-rocketing drug prices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The memo, which was sent to Democratic members of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the staff of its top Democrat Elijah Cummings, reveals that Valeant previously withheld readily available analyst reports prepared by banks such as Goldman Sachs, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege. The memo says it also raises questions about other documents that are still being withheld, saying some of these “were not drafted by attorneys and do not include communications with attorneys.” A spokeswoman for Valeant denied that the company has done anything wrong, saying it has already provided more than 78,000 pages of documents and will continue cooperating. “We continue to discuss with the committee the issue of privileged documents, but any suggestion that we have withheld documents inappropriately is incorrect,” Laurie Little said in a statement. The April 26 memo comes just one day before three of Valeant’s top executives are slated to appear before a different U.S. Senate panel that is also investigating high drug prices. The company’s outgoing CEO Michael Pearson will be testifying before the Senate Special Committee on Aging late Wednesday afternoon, along with activist investor William Ackman, a majority shareholder and board member, and Howard Schiller, a director and former chief financial officer. Their appearance before Congress comes at an awkward and difficult time for the company, which is under fire from its shareholders and facing a number of ongoing government investigations into drug pricing and distribution, accounting and disclosures, and antitrust matters. Last month, the company announced that Pearson would be stepping down and that Ackman would be joining its board, after a board committee probe into the company’s dealings with specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services uncovered accounting problems dating back to December 2014. The company said it would restate its earnings and delay filing its annual report, opening the door to a possible default on its $30 billion debt. The company has blamed some of the accounting problems on Schiller, and asked him to step down from his board seat. Schiller has refused to do so, and has denied any wrongdoing through his attorney. Valeant plans to file its annual report on April 29, two days after the hearing. Wednesday’s hearing will be primarily focused on Valeant’s drastic price increases for two of its heart drugs. The committee previously planned to vote to hold Pearson in contempt for failing to be deposed, but backed down after he agreed to be interviewed April 18. ",

         "Trump (once again) may be losing his biggest cheerleader   okay, second biggest cheerleader after Rudy Giuliani   Ann Coulter.Coulter, author of New York Times bestselling  In Trump We Must  recently took to twitter to already denounce Donald Trump, who he feels is about to initiate the biggest sell-out in politics over immigration.After conservative writer Mickey Kraus expressed worry over Mike Pence and Paul Ryan s  pledge  to tackle immigration head-on, Coulter tweeted:Sounds like the big sell-out is coming. Oh well. The voters did what we could. If Trump sells out, it s not our fault. https://t.co/tdMpAuDaRI  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) December 2, 2016Actually Ann, it is your fault. You and all the voters (even though Trump lost the popular vote by over 2.5 million) put a notorious, serial liar in office for the next four years. Someone who flip-flopped on every issue imaginable (and then lied about flip-flopping) is going to be President of th United States, so don t act all shocked when it turns out he was   surprise   a major sell-out to the  people. The exchange that seemed to put Kaus and Coulter on edge was an interview Mike Pence gave with Scott Pelley:PELLEY: Just since the election, President-elect Trump has reversed himself on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and on deporting 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. Did he just say those things to get elected? Did he never intend to do them?PENCE: I think what the American people know they have in President-elect Donald Trump is someone who speaks straight from his mind and straight from his heart. And on the issue of illegal immigration, I promise you, as we were meeting yesterday on Capitol Hill with leaders of the House and Senate, we re going to go straight to work after this Congress convenes and this administration takes office. And we re going to pass policies that will end illegal immigration in this country.Doesn t seem like anything bad, and on the surface it looks like something every conservative should want. But when one factors in that Republicans are seeking to repeal Obamacare, deregulate Wall Street, and begin confirmation hearings for the next SCOTUS pick, immigration reform happening  right away  may seem like a distant hope for xenophobes like Kaus and Coulter.It looks like Trump is losing support from Coulter and he s not even president yet. It wouldn t be the first time Coulter seemed to back off of supporting Trump. It certainly won t be the last time either.Featured image Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images",

         "DUBAI (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson flew to Tehran on Saturday to seek the release of a jailed British-Iranian aid worker. The Foreign Office said Johnson spoke  frankly  with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif about  consular cases of dual nationals  such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who Britain says was visiting family on holiday when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government. The case has taken on domestic political importance in Britain, especially since Johnson said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe trained journalists, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. Johnson is also expected to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday to discuss bilateral and regional issues, a Foreign Office official said, during just the third visit by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Talks with Zarif were  constructive , Johnson s office said, despite differences between the two countries.  They both spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship, including the Foreign Secretary s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in a statement. The two-day visit takes place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions. Johnson stressed Britain s support for Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in the meeting, the spokeswoman said. International sanctions against Iran have only recently been lifted as part of the multilateral nuclear deal to curb Tehran s disputed uranium enrichment program.  That deal is under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to decertify Iran s compliance with its terms. Johnson told Zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented. Johnson also met Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security Council, and parliament speaker Ali Larijani during the first day of his two-day visit, Iran s state news agency IRNA reported. The Foreign Office statement did not mention Zaghari-Ratcliffe by name, although Johnson has vowed to leave  no stone unturned  in Britain s efforts to free her.  A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but has become the most high-profile case. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been told she will appear in court on Dec. 10, her husband Richard has said. The visit is a test of Johnson s ability to navigate a political landscape littered with potential pitfalls. Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into a pariah state for most of the West and many Middle Eastern neighbors. Britain has voiced its continued support for the nuclear deal but is one of a number of Western powers voicing concerns about Tehran s  destabilizing  influence in the region. ",

         "(Reuters) - The 2016 election cycle had been a ratings boon for U.S. cable news networks, and Tuesday’s stunning U.S. presidential election victory by Republican Donald Trump was no different. Time Warner Inc’s CNN led all U.S. TV networks in primetime coverage with 13.3 million viewers, the most-watched Election Night coverage in U.S. cable news history, according to Nielsen data. 21st Century Fox’s Fox News came in second with 12.1 million viewers, and Comcast Corp’s MSNBC was far behind with just under 6 million. Among adults aged 25 to 54, the demographic most important to advertisers who buy time on news programs, CNN was first as well with 6.7 million viewers. Fox News was second with 4.6 million and MSNBC drew 2.4 million in the demographic. All three posted gains from four years ago. With many states too close to call, the race was not called for Trump until around 3 a.m. (0800 GMT) on the East Coast. Fox News led cable news with 9.8 million viewers watching between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. (0700 and 0800 GMT), with CNN bringing in 6.5 million and 2.9 million watching on MSNBC.  Fox News also led all cable networks with their full coverage from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. (0000 to 0800), with 12.2 million, a network high for an election night. CNN pulled in 11.2 million for the whole night, but topped Fox News in the news demographic with 5.6 million to Fox News’ 4.8 million. MSNBC brought up the rear with 5.2 million and 2.1 million in the demographic. NBC led all the broadcast networks with 11.2 million viewers, with ABC finishing with 9.2 million and CBS pulling in 8.1 million. Fox averaged around 4 million for its two-hour coverage from 8-10 p.m.  Across 13 U.S. TV networks, election night coverage was watched by 71.42 million viewers, just behind the U.S. record of 71.47 million that watched in 2008.

Hillary Clinton s emails on her unsecured, homebrew server contained intelligence from the U.S. government s most secretive and highly classified programs, according to an unclassified letter from a top inspector general to senior lawmakers.Fox News exclusively obtained the unclassified letter, sent Jan. 14 from Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III. It laid out the findings of a recent comprehensive review by intelligence agencies that identified  several dozen  additional classified emails   including specific intelligence known as  special access programs  (SAP).That indicates a level of classification beyond even  top secret,  the label previously given to two emails found on her server, and brings even more scrutiny to the presidential candidate s handling of the government s closely held secrets. To date, I have received two sworn declarations from one [intelligence community] element. These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined by the IC element to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,  said the IG letter to lawmakers with oversight of the intelligence community and State Department.  According to the declarant, these documents contain information derived from classified IC element sources. Intelligence from a  special access program,  or SAP, is even more sensitive than that designated as  top secret    as were two emails identified last summer in a random sample pulled from Clinton s private server she used as secretary of state. Access to a SAP is restricted to those with a  need-to-know  because exposure of the intelligence would likely reveal the source, putting a method of intelligence collection   or a human asset   at risk. Currently, some 1,340 emails designated  classified  have been found on Clinton s server, though the Democratic presidential candidate insists the information was not classified at the time. There is absolutely no way that one could not recognize SAP material,  a former senior law enforcement with decades of experience investigating violations of SAP procedures told Fox News.  It is the most sensitive of the sensitive. Executive Order 13526   called  Classified National Security Information  and signed Dec. 29, 2009   sets out the legal framework for establishing special access programs. The order says the programs can only be authorized by the president,  the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each. The programs are created when  the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional,  and  the number of persons who ordinarily will have access will be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved,  it states.According to court documents, former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted for sharing intelligence from special access programs with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell. At the heart of his prosecution was a non-disclosure agreement where Petraeus agreed to protect these closely held government programs, with the understanding  unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention or negligent handling   could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation.  Clinton signed an identical non-disclosure agreement Jan. 22, 2009.While the State Department and Clinton campaign have said the emails in questions were  retroactively classified  or  upgraded    to justify the more than 1,300 classified emails on her server   those terms are meaningless under federal law.The former federal law enforcement official said the finding in the January IG letter represents a potential violation of USC 18 Section 793,  gross negligence  in the handling of secure information under the Espionage Act.

         "when it comes to interpreting current events no one does official conspiracy theories like the unite statesfor years washington has tried to promulgate a propaganda campaign which tries to somehow link al qaeda to iran or isis to iran for the mentallychallenged members of the rightwing media in the us this isn t a massive feat as a large segment of that audience cannot even locate iran on a global map there is also the issue of us warhawks like lindsey graham and john mccain being proven pathological liars who will say anything regardless of whether it s based in actual fact all of this contributes to a number of shallow creative narratives which continuously circulate between fox news the atlantic magazine tel aviv riyadh and the us senateand just like the us and uk mainstream media s coverage of syria the deep throat source in this dossier is al qaedathis latest chapter in the us fantasy world of iranian intrigue attempts to further the israelifavoured mythology blaming iran for all of the region s woes make no mistake the american neoconservative wing and their israeli benefactors are determined to invent new conditions for war with iran image bush s al qaeda  guy abu musab al zarqawigareth porter the american conservative for many years major us institutions ranging from the pentagon to the  commission have been pushing the line that iran secretly cooperated with al qaeda both before and after the  terror attacks but the evidence for those claims remained either secret or sketchy and always highly questionablein early november however the mainstream media claimed to have its smoking gun a cia document written by an unidentified al qaeda official and released in conjunction with  neverbeforeseen documents seized from osama bin laden s house in abbottabad pakistanthe associated press reported that the al qaeda document appears to bolster us claims that iran supported the extremist network leading up to the september  terror attacks the wall street journal said the document provides new insights into al qaeda s relationship with iran suggesting a pragmatic alliance that emerged out of shared hatred of the united states and saudi arabia nbc news wrote that the document reveals that at various points in the relationship iran offered al qaeda help in the form of money arms and training in hezbollah camps in lebanon in exchange for striking american interests in the gulf implying that al qaeda had declined the offerformer obama national security council spokesman ned price writing for the atlantic went even further asserting that the document includes an account of a deal with iranian authorities to host and train saudial qaeda members as long as they have agreed to plot against their common enemy american interests in the gulf region but none of those media reports were based on any careful reading of the document s contents the  arabiclanguage document which was translated in full for the american conservative doesn t support the media narrative of new evidence of iranal qaeda cooperation either before or after  at allit provides no evidence whatsoever of tangible iranian assistance to al qaeda on the contrary it confirms previous evidence that iranian authorities quickly rounded up those al qaeda operatives living in the country when they were able to track them down and held them in isolation to prevent any further contact with al qaeda units outside irantaken by surprisewhat it shows is that the al qaeda operatives were led to believe iran was friendly to their cause and were quite taken by surprise when their people were arrested in two waves in late  it suggests that iran had played them gaining the fighters trust while maximizing intelligence regarding al qaeda s presence in irannevertheless this account which appears to have been written by a midlevel al qaeda cadre in  appears to bolster an internal al qaeda narrative that the terror group rejected iranian blandishments and were wary of what they saw as untrustworthiness on the part of the iranians the author asserts the iranians offered saudi al qaeda members who had entered the country money and arms anything they need and training with hezbollah in exchange for hitting american interests in saudi arabia and the gulf but there is no word about whether any iranian arms or money were ever actually given to al qaeda fighters and the author acknowledges that the saudis in question were among those who had been deported during sweeping arrests casting doubt over whether there was ever any deal in the offingthe author suggests al qaeda rejected iranian assistance on principle we don t need them he insisted thanks to god we can do without them and nothing can come from them but evil that theme is obviously important to maintaining organizational identity and morale but later in the document the author expresses deep bitterness about what they obviously felt was iranian doubledealing in  to  they are ready to playact he writes of the iranians their religion is lies and keeping quiet and usually they show what is contrary to what is in their mind  it is hereditary with them deep in their character the author recalls that al qaeda operatives were ordered to move to iran in march  three months after they had left afghanistan for waziristan or elsewhere in pakistan the document by the way says nothing of any activity in iran before  he acknowledges that most of his cadres entered iran illegally although some of them obtained visas from the iranian consulate in karachiamong the latter was abu hafs al mauritani an islamic scholar who was ordered by the leadership shura in pakistan to seek iranian permission for al qaeda fighters and families to pass through iran or to stay there for an extended period he was accompanied by middle and lowerranking cadres including some who worked for abu musab al zarqawi the account clearly suggests that zarqawi himself had remained in hiding after entering iran illegallystrict conditionsabu hafs al mauratani did reach an understanding with iran according to the al qaeda account but it had nothing to do with providing arms or money it was a deal that allowed them to remain for some period or to pass through the country but only on the condition that they observe very strict security conditions no meetings no use of cell phones no movements that would attract attention the account attributes those restrictions to iranian fears of us retribution which was undoubtedly part of the motivation but it is clear iran viewed al qaeda as an extremist salafist security threat to itself as wellmost of the al qaeda visitors according to the al qaeda document settled in zahedan the capital of sistan and baluchistan province where the majority of the population are sunnis and speak baluchi they generally violated the security restrictions imposed by the iranians they established links with the baluchis who he notes were also salafists and began holding meetings some of them even made direct contact by phone with salafist militants in chechnya where a conflict was rapidly spiraling out of control saif aladel one of the leading al qaeda figures in iran at the time later revealed that the al qaeda fighting contingent under abu musab al zarqawi s command immediately began reorganizing to return to afghanistanwaves of arreststhe first iranian campaign to round up al qaeda personnel which the author of the documents says was focused on zahedan came in may or june  no more than three months after they have had entered iran those arrested were either jailed or deported to their home countries the saudi foreign minister praised iran in august for having transferred  al qaeda suspects to the saudi government in junein february  iranian security launched a new wave of arrests this time they captured three major groups of al qaeda operatives in tehran and mashad including zarqawi and other top leaders in the country according to the document saif al adel later revealed in a post on a proal qaeda website in  reported in the saudiowned newspaper asharq alawsat that the iranians had succeeded in capturing  percent of the group associated with zarqawi and that it had caused the failure of  percent of our plan the anonymous author writes that the initial iran policy was to deport those arrested and that zarqawi was allowed to go to iraq where he plotted attacks on shia and coalition forces until his death in  but then he says the policy suddenly changed and the iranians stopped deportations instead opting to keep the al qaeda senior leadership in custody presumably as bargaining chips yes iran deported  al qaeda suspects to other countries including saudi arabia in  but the al qaeda leaders were held in iran not as bargaining chips but under tight security to prevent them from communicating with the al qaeda networks elsewhere in the region which bush administration officials eventually acknowledgedafter the arrests and imprisonment of senior al qaeda figures the al qaeda leadership became increasingly angry at iran in november  unknown gunmen abducted an iran consular official in peshawar pakistan and in july  al qaeda operatives in yemen kidnapped an iranian diplomat in march  iran reportedly released five of the senior al qaeda in prison including said aladel in return for the release of the diplomat in yemenin a document taken from the abbottabad compound and published by west point s counterterrorism center in  a senior al qaeda official wrote we believe that our efforts which included escalating a political and media campaign the threats we made the kidnapping of their friend the commercial counselor in the iranian consulate in peshawar and other reasons that scared them based on what they saw we are capable of to be among the reasons that led them to expedite the release of these prisoners there was a time when iran did view al qaeda as an ally it was during and immediately after the war of the mujahedin against soviet troops in afghanistan that of course was the period when the cia was backing bin laden s efforts as well but after the taliban seized power in kabul in  and especially after taliban troops killed  iranian diplomats in mazarisharif in  the iranian view of al qaeda changed fundamentally since then iran has clearly regarded it as an extreme sectarian terrorist organization and its sworn enemy what has not changed is the determination of the us national security state and the supporters of israel to maintain the myth of an enduring iranian support for al qaedagareth porter is an independent journalist and winner of the  gellhorn prize for journalism this article originally appeared at the american

         "donald trump spent monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate we were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight and it was quite the spectacle from lies to selfincrimination watching the gop nominee s performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after anotherso here you go a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of donald trump s mouth during the first presidential debate there s nobody in our government to fight them chin and we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight they re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies our country s in deep trouble we don t know what we re doing with devaluations especially when it comes to china they re the best they re the best ever at it what they re doing to us is a very very sad thing that s called business by the way referring to making money off of the  financial collapse i m a great believer in all forms of energy our country is losing a so much in terms of energy in terms of paying off our debt i will bring back jobs you can t bring back jobs that s about all you ve got referring to clinton s book we are stronger together you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history you are going to drive businesses out i m going to cut taxes bigleague you are going to raise taxes bigleague and take a look at mine also referring to his campaign website she tells us how to fight isis on her website i don t think douglas macarthur would like that too much you re telling the enemy everything you want to do no wonder you ve been fighting isis your entire adult life well i m really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs they re going to expand their companies they re going to do a tremendous job hahahaha i m getting rid of the carried interest provision and if you really look it s really not a great thing for the wealthy it s really a great thing for middle class methinks thou dost protest too much these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when they re going to bring  trillion dollars back from overseas where they can t bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton won t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad or because those companies are greedy and unamerican just saying so what they re doing is leaving our country and believe it or not they re leaving our country because the taxes are too high because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can t work out a deal and everybody agrees it should be brought back instead of that they re leaving our country to get their money because they can t bring their money back into our country because of bureacratic red tape because they can t get together because we have a president that can t sit them around a table and get them to approve something maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we don t need to cut valuable public services we have no leadership and honestly that starts with secretary clinton why not blame clinton for everythin we re in a bubble right now and the only thing that looks good is the stock market we have a fed that is doing political things the fed is being more political than secretary clinton when we have a country that s doing so badly that s being ripped off by every single country in the world it s the kind of thinking that our country needs we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals in response to a question about his taxes i ve been under audit for almost  years i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited i say have you been audited i get audited almost every year and in a way i should be complaining i m not even complaining i don t mind it it s almost become a way of life i get audited by the irs but other people don t we have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of i will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes that makes me smart in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes i could give you a list of banks if that would help you i would give you a list of banks these are very fine institutions very fine banks i could do that very quickly i have a tremendous income the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way it s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money our airports are like from a third world country we ve become a third world country the worst of all things has happened and it s really a shame and it s politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem our country has tremendous problems we re a debtor nation we re a serious debtor nation and we have a country that needs new roads new tunnels new bridges new airports new schools new hospitals and we don t have the money because it s been squandered on so many of your ideas it would be squandered too believe me in response to not paying any federal income taxes maybe he didn t do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work which our country should do too referring to not paying people who worked for him but on occasion four times we used certain laws that are there and when secretary clinton talks about people that didn t get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation now if you want to change the laws you ve been there a long time change the laws but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because i m running a company my obligation right now is to do well for myself my family my employees for my companies and that s what i do referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts but what she doesn t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me i ll give you an example we re just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house so if i don t get there one way i m going to get to pennsylvania avenue another when we look at the budget the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy well first of all secretary clinton doesn t want to use a couple of words and that s law and order and we need law and order if we don t have it we re not going to have a country now whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk which worked very well mayor giuliani is here worked very well in new york we have to be we have to know what we re doing right now our police in many cases are afraid to do anything no you re wrong it went before a judge who was a very againstpolice judge it was taken away from her and our mayor our new mayor refused to go forward with the case they would have won an appeal if you look at it throughout the country there are many places where it s allowed referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional we need law and order and we need law and order in the inner cities because the people that are most affected by what s happening are africanamerican and hispanic people and it s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen i have the endorsement of the nra which i m very proud of these are very very good people but i think we have to look very strongly at nofly lists and watch lists and when people are on there even if they shouldn t be on there we ll help them we ll help them legally we ll help them get off but i tend to agree with that quite strongly but stopand frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city tremendous beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very very big impact they ve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians because that s what it is they ve controlled these communities for up to  years you know you ve seen me i ve been all over the place you decided to stay home and that s ok but i will tell you i ve been all over and i ve met some of the greatest people i ll ever meet within these communities when i got involved i didn t fail i got him to give the birth certificate so i m satisfied with it and i ll tell you why i m satisfied with it but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good job well it was very i say nothing i say nothing because i was able to get him to produce it he should have produced it a long time before i say nothing but let me just tell you when you talk about healing i think that i ve developed very very good relationships over the last little while with the africanamerican community i think you can see that and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate first of all i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are it doesn t work that way you were after him now as far as the lawsuit yes when i was very young i went into my father s company had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens and we along with many many other companies throughout the country it was a federal lawsuit were sued we settled the suit with zero with no admission of guilt it was very easy to do and you know i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways which i don t do on you maybe i m trying to save the money but frankly i look i look at that and i say isn t that amazing because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms and it s just one of those things i ll go one step further in palm beach florida tough community a brilliant community a wealthy community probably the wealthiest community there is in the world i opened a club and really got great credit for it no discrimination against african americans against muslims against anybody and it s a tremendously successful club and i m so glad i did it and i have been given great credit for what i did and i m very very proud of it and that s the way i feel that is the true way i feel in addition i was just endorsed by ice they ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration i was just endorsed by ice as far as the cyber i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said we should be better than anybody else and perhaps we re not i don t think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc she s saying russia russia russia but i don t maybe it was i mean it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lots of other people it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs  pounds ok now whether that was russia whether that was china whether it was another country we don t know because the truth is under president obama we ve lost control of things that we used to have control over we came in with the internet we came up with the internet and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what isis is doing with the internet they re beating us at our own game isis so we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare it is it is a huge problem i have a son he s  years old he has computers he is so good with these computers it s unbelievable the security aspect of cyber is very very tough and maybe it s hardly doable but i will say we are not doing the job we should be doing but that s true throughout our whole governmental society we have so many things that we have to do better and certainly cyber is one of them so she talks about taking them out she s been doing it a long time she s been trying to take them out for a long time but they wouldn t have even been formed if they left some troops behind like  or maybe something more than that and then you wouldn t have had them speaking about the creation of isis or as i ve been saying for a long time and i think you ll agree because i said it to you once had we taken the oil and we should have taken the oil isis would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income and now they have the oil all over the place including the oil a lot of the oil in libya wrong wrong wrong the secretary said very strongly about working with we ve been working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyone s ever seen but you look at the middle east you started the iran deal that s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall i mean they were doing so badly they were choking on the sanctions and now they re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon the way they re going number one the  countries of nato many of them aren t paying their fair share number two and that bothers me because we should be asking we re defending them and they should at least be paying us what they re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract and number two i said and very strongly nato could be obsolete because and i was very strong on this and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times which is unusual for the new york times to be honest but i said they do not focus on terror and i was very strong and i said it numerous times and about four months ago i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division and i think that s great and i think we should get because we pay approximately  percent of the cost of nato it s a lot of money to protect other people but i m all for nato but i said they have to focus on terror also and they re going to do that and that was believe me i m sure i m not going to get credit for it but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato and believe me you were the ones that took out the troops not only that you named the day they couldn t believe it they sat back probably and said i can t believe it but you were there and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant now it s in over  countries and you re going to stop them i don t think so that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media well i have much better judgment than she does there s no question about that i also have a much better temperament than she has you know i have a much better she spent let me tell you she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising you know they get madison avenue into a room they put names oh temperament let s go after i think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament i have a winning temperament i know how to win she does not have a wait the aflcio the other day behind the blue screen i don t know who you were talking to secretary clinton but you were totally out of control i said there s a person with a temperament that s got a problem wrong it s lies that line s getting a little bit old i must say i would like to it s not an accurate one at all it s not an accurate one so i just want to give a lot of things and just to respond i agree with her on one thing the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapons not global warming like you think and your your president thinks nuclear is the single greatest threat just to go down the list we defend japan we defend germany we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia we defend countries they do not pay us but they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune that s why we re losing we re losing we lose on everything i say who makes these we lose on everything all i said that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share because this isn t  years ago where we could do what we re doing we can t defend japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million all i said was they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out we re a country that owes  trillion they have to help us out well i have to say that you know for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia she s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries but russia has been expanding their they have a much newer capability than we do we have not been updating from the new standpoint we are not we are not keeping up with other countries i would like everybody to end it just get rid of it but i would certainly not do first strike i think that once the nuclear alternative happens it s over at the same time we have to be prepared i can t take anything off the table because you look at some of these countries you look at north korea we re doing nothing there china should solve that problem for us china should go into north korea china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea why didn t you add other things into the deal one of the great giveaways of all time of all time including  million in cash nobody s ever seen that before that turned out to be wrong it was actually  billion in cash obviously i guess for the hostages it certainly looks that way so you say to yourself why didn t they make the right deal this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history and they re going to end up getting nuclear i met with bibi netanyahu the other day believe me he s not a happy camper but i will tell you that hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis which she could have defeated by never having it you know get going in the first place right now it s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because they re in more and more places more and more states more and more nations and she doesn t say that because she s got no business ability we need heart we need a lot of things but you have to have some basic ability and sadly she doesn t have that all you have to do is speak to them wait you have so many different things you have to be able to do and i don t believe that hillary has the stamina the world let me tell you let me tell you hillary has experience but it s bad experience we have made so many bad deals during the last so she s got experience that i agree but it s bad bad experience i never said that i didn t say that where did you find this oh really you know hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials some of it s said in entertainment some of it s said somebody who s been very vicious to me rosie o donnell i said very tough things to her and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her but you want to know the truth i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary to her family and i said to myself i can t do it i just can t do it it s inappropriate it s not nice wow in hindsight it would have probably been easier to list the things trump said that weren t completely and utterly ridiculous when it finally came time to face off with hillary clinton on the debate stage trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself as hillary said monday night donald lives in his own reality presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sensefeatured image via win mcnameegetty images",

         "washingtonhong kong reuters  us lawmakers should take action to ban china’s stateowned firms from acquiring us companies a congressional panel charged with monitoring security and trade links between washington and beijing said on wednesday in its annual report to congress the uschina economic and security review commission said the chinese communist party has used statebacked enterprises as the primary economic tool to advance and achieve its national security objectives the report recommended congress prohibit us acquisitions by such entities by changing the mandate of cfius the us government body that conducts security reviews of proposed acquisitions by foreign firms “the commission recommends congress amend the statute authorizing the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius to bar chinese stateowned enterprises from acquiring or otherwise gaining effective control of us companies” the report said cfius led by the us treasury and with representatives from eight other agencies including the departments of defense state and homeland security now has veto power over acquisitions from foreign private and statecontrolled firms if it finds that a deal would threaten us national security or critical infrastructure if enacted the panel’s recommendation would essentially create a blanket ban on us purchases by chinese stateowned enterprises the report “has again revealed the commission’s stereotypes and prejudices” chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said in beijing “we ask that chinese companies investing abroad abide by local laws and regulations and we hope that relevant countries will create a level playing field” he told a daily news briefing the panel’s report is purely advisory but could carry extra weight this year because they come as presidentelect donald trump’s transition team is formulating its trade and foreign policy agenda and vetting candidates for key economic and security positions congress also could be more receptive after us voter sentiment against job losses to china and mexico helped republicans retain control of both the house and the senate in last week’s election trump strongly criticized china throughout the us election campaign grabbing headlines with his pledges to slap  percent tariffs on imported chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office “chinese state owned enterprises are arms of the chinese state” dennis shea chairman of the uschina economic and security review commission told a news conference “we don’t want the us government purchasing companies in the united states why would we want the chinese communist government purchasing companies in the united states” the recommendation to change laws governing cfius was one of  proposals the panel made to congress on the military side it called for a government investigation into how far outsourcing to china has weakened the us defense industry the  panel also said congress should pass legislation that would require its preapproval of any move by the us commerce department to declare china a “market economy” and limit antidumping tariffs against the country the united states and us businesses attracted a record  billion worth of deals involving buyers from mainland china this year more than any other country targeted by chinese buyers according to thomson reuters data the push into the united states is part of a global overseas buying spree by chinese companies that this year has seen a record  billion worth of deals nearly double last year’s tally cfius has shown a higher degree of activism against chinese buyers this year catching some by surprise prominent deals that fell victim to cfius include tsinghua holdings’  billion investment in western digital wdco overall data do not demonstrate cfius has been a significant obstacle for chinese investment in the united states in  the latest year for which data is available china topped the list of foreign countries in cfius review with  deals reviewed out of more than  scrutinized by cfius although the number of chinese transactions reviewed rose in absolute terms it fell as a share of overall chinese acquisitions the report noted and the vast majority of deals reviewed by cfius were cleared ",

active push to teach islam in schoolsthis is disturbing for all parents cair has taken it upon themselves to claim that they need to fight islamophobia  they see this as a problem but we see this as a shady way to have islam taught in schools  we see what they re doing but the bleeding heart liberals in san diego are just passively accepting this propagandajanet levy of american thinker if allowed to stand the sdusd antibullying program geared specifically to the cairidentified needs of muslim students could mark a dangerous departure from treasured constitutional principles and first amendment protections this case warrants serious attention as it has grave implications for the direction of education and the supremacy of islam in the nation there s a huge problem on so many levels with this the most obvious one is that a christian would be hammered for even remotely trying to push christianity on the kids so why should we accept teaching islam to our kids the answer is we shouldn t dad

with a decadelong history of yielding to islamic demands and recent more alarming submissions san diego city schools appear to be ground zero for islamic indoctrination within american public schools the current capitulation includes an islamcentric curriculum with input and resources from a muslim brotherhoodaffiliated organization which raises first amendment issues as well as serious concerns of favoritism toward muslims students over students of other faithsthis past week sdusd in collaboration with the council on american islam relations cair instituted an antibullying campaign aimed specifically at protecting muslims students in launching the initiative sdusd cited an unsubstantiated study by cair claiming that  of american muslim students surveyed in california said they were bullied because of their religion the new program will include adding lessons on islam to the social studies curriculum that emphasize prominent muslims in history creating muslimonly safe spaces adding muslim holidays to the school calendar and providing support and resources for muslim students during ramadanaccording to stan anjan sdusd s executive director of family and community engagement the new program will focus on promoting a positive image of islam special disciplinary measures will also be created for the socalled bullying of muslims cited by cair instead of detention the school plans a restorative justice program in which students dialogue with each other about perceived bullying words or actions educational materials on islam and resource listings will be provided to parents and school personnel as wellcair a radical fundamentalist front group for hamas according to terrorism expert steve emerson was named as an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas

together cair billing itself as a benign muslim civil rights organization has long been at the forefront in pressuring schools and businesses to accommodate the special needs of muslims in  cair complained of favoritism when christian students in roseville a detroit suburb were given permission slips to attend offsite bible study classes yet cair pushed in  for dearborn public schools to accommodate muslim prayer on school grounds and early friday dismissals for jumu ah prayers the organization has pressured schools to have a say on textbook selection and to feature its own lecturers for school assemblies when a public school teacher in concrete washington referenced the taliban and hamas while citing examples of the use of violence to bully people cair cried racism and called for a federal investigation saying the teacher had veered off topic to make antimuslim statements the school district responded that the teacher s comments were taken out of contextmohebi the head of cair san diego has been pushing the antiislamophobia program he recently tried to prevent the san diego police department from attending a training session on islamic terrorism featuring ryan mauro national security analyst for the clarion project a nonprofit dedicated to exposing the dangers of islamic extremism mohebi said officers would be learning conspiracy theories from mauro further mohebi importuned that no taxpayer dollars should pay for the training and that the sdpd should not confer continuing education credits for attendance in a further attempt to control police training on islam mohebi requested the ability to monitor police training to vouch for its accuracy and to provide clarifications throughout the sessioncair s recent activity and its incursion into the san

realignment of school curricula and the students learning environment to the recommendations of a religious organization whose stated mission is to enhance the understanding of islam and empower american muslims the fcdf maintains that the first amendment prohibits a government agency from attempting to effect a secular goal by the propagation of religious concepts limandri points out the litigious pitfalls of a curriculum which could easily be construed as a governmental endorsement of a religion he also cautions that cair s interpretation of the term bullying could extend to the stifling of criticism of islam further impinging on first amendment protectionscitizens for quality education san diego a nonpartisan group of citizens concerned about public education voiced their opposition to the new islamicfriendly curriculum and characterized it as an attempt to implement at local schools antiamerican sharia law incompatible with the us constitution the group criticized the
